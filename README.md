To create my Google page, I first coded all the tags I already knew, starting with the HTML and then the CSS.

I tried to look at the source code as little as possible so I could figure things out on my own as much as possible.

After watching the workshop on HTML and CSS, I realized there were much simpler ways to do what I had done, but I still decided to keep my original code to show what I managed to do by myself.

So, in the body, I added the top, middle, and bottom divs. Inside them, I placed all the buttons, the h1, and the search bar input.

After filling each tag with the appropriate content, I added a span style inside the h1 to change the color of each letter of “Google”.

I then moved on to the CSS. I added all the corresponding selectors and filled them in. I positioned my buttons on the page using margin-top, margin-left or right, and text-align.

I played around with these until I understood how they worked. I tried many other properties to see what they did, but since they weren’t what I needed, I deleted them.

If I had to summarize how I worked, I would say I did a lot of testing, and I used Google a bit when I couldn’t find the answer. 

It’s probably not the best or cleanest way to do things, but I’m still happy I managed to do it on my own, especially since not long ago I had no knowledge of coding at all.

If you have any other questions, I’d be happy to answer them.
